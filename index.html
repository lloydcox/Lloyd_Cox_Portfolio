                                  <h3>Work</h3>
                                  <p>
                                    I started my work career at 15 and my first job was in removals, it was a good way to earn some money over the summer holidays,
                                    but it did not last long as the company went under.<br><br>
                                    I then went through several jobs, from office clerk to warehouse operative to air conditioning installer apprentice.
                                    It was when I started carpentry, I found something I really enjoyed and stuck with for 6 years.<br><br>
                                    After that I went in to accounting, I was holding down two jobs, one was an apprenticeship as an Income assistant at Hanover housing
                                    and the other was a market operator at Betfair and was also studying accountancy two nights a week. 
                                    I was then lucky enough to get a job at the Follett Office where I would have my accounting qualifications paid for by the company. 
                                    Halfway through I was earning good money, but the job was not fulfilling a missing part of me.<br><br>
                                    I started a side project called The Human Codex which is a side project of mine. It ended up taking me to Croatia traveling for 6 months, 
                                    and back to the UK again. The whole process made me realise I really wanted to be a web developer, after seeing what others were able to do
                                    I wanted to have the skills and knowledge to finish making the platform myself.<br><br>
                                    I ended up finding out about the Netmatters Scion scheme, ever since I have been working hard daily to achieve my dream of becoming
                                    a web developer.

                                  <h3>Personal</h3>
                                  <p>
                                    I always find these types of things hard to write but I will give it a go. I am a trainee web developer
                                    who has a passion for life. I love all things tech, fantasy, sci-fi and life really. I work hard, 
                                    try my best at what I do and always try to do the right thing, which sometimes ends up to my detriment.<br><br>

                                    I have had a number of different jobs, a wide range of life experiences and am a bit of a loner. I do 
                                    enjoy the company of other people; I just find it hard sometimes. I was diagnosed as High Functioning 
                                    Autistic and ADHD when I was 30, which really hit me for six but as time has gone on, I have learned 
                                    how to handle the diagnosis and try to use it to my advantage. I believe I wasn’t really self-aware of 
                                    my self until this point, literally livig in my own fantasy world not really knowing what or how I may 
                                    of affected other people and in turn what they thought of/about me.<br><br>

                                    With a strong sense of justice, I always try to do the right thing, and not to let anyone done, although this
                                    tends to get me in trouble sometimes. I am not a gameplayer when it comes to people and am a straight shooter
                                      some have said. This doesn’t mean I try to be awkward I just try my best at making sure the right thing is 
                                      done for everyone.<br><br>

                                    I hope to get to live to see the day that humanity has a colony on another celestial body and or we are visited
                                    from another species not from this world. I have faith that one day humanity will become the species it has the
                                      potential to be and things like war, poverty, greed and corruption will no longer play a role in humanities future.<br><br>
                                      
                                    My family are the most important thing to me, I love my son more than words could ever descirbe, I will do anything for him 
                                    and hope when he grows up he is proud of the man I have become. I couldn't ask for a better partner and will love her until 
                                    my heart stops beating.<br><br>

                                    The main thing I wish for in life is that they both get to live long and happy lives, I will do whatever I can to make that
                                    the reality.

                                      Quote Wizard that needed to meet certain criterias, these were:<br><br>
                                      - The ability to add a new customer.<br>
                                      -         The ability to control how many items can be ordered.<br>
                                      -         Display the itemized billing information.<br>
                                      -         The use of a dropdown selection menu. <br><br>
                                      This took me a little bit of time to get my head round but once I did I enjoyed the task 
                                      and what Axure has to offer. I can see why a lot of people use it and am interested to 
                                      try other software.

                                  <p class="project-text hide">In this project, I was tasked to replicate a pre-existing website. 
                                    The mark-up for the site is written and is styled to match the site, ensuring the site looks 
                                    consistent across all viewport widths although some of the methods used were different, the 
                                    outcome was the same. I used mainly flex-box to attain a responsive layout, and SaaS to help 
                                    speed the website up.<br><br>
                                    I used a mixture of code I had written, and plug-ins to implement the JS used in the NetMatters 
                                    home page. I found that writing the code was good to help understand fundamental basics of JS and 
                                    using the plug-ins allowed me to learn when it is more efficient and effective to use a plug-in.<br><br>
                                    I used PHP/MySQL to create two databases, a contact form, and a blog. The contact form uses it’s on 
                                    table in the database to store any contact forms that are sent, and the blog uses it’s on table to 
                                    generate the latest blog posts.<br><br>

                                    I really really liked this task, having a design to work of and using Peeper tool made this 
                                    fun and enjoyable.

                                    The reflection tasks were as follows:<br>
                                    <br>
                                  - Build a 5 page WordPress website, with SEO in-mind<br>
                                  - Your reflection should include, but is not limited to:<br>
                                  - Homepage<br>
                                  - Contact Page<br>
                                  - News<br>
                                  - Gallery images that open within a lightbox<br>
                                  <br>
                                    I really enjoyed this reflection, I had some previous WordPress experience and doing the course and reflection 
                                    helped grow my knowledge and experience with it. I chose to do the reflection based on my side project 
                                    as I had a lot of the media already and it was something close to me.

                                  -         The schedule needed to be on a calendar from 07:00 am – 16:00 with the charging times blocked
