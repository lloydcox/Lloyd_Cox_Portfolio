                                        - The ability to add a new customer.<br>
                                        -         The ability to control how many items can be ordered.<br>

                                        -         The use of a dropdown selection menu. <br><br>
                                        This took me a little bit of time to get my head round but once I did I enjoyed the task 
                                        and what Axure has to offer. I can see why a lot of people use it and am interested to 
                                        try other software.

                                    <p class="project-text hide">In this project, I was tasked to replicate a pre-existing website. 
                                      The mark-up for the site is written and is styled to match the site, ensuring the site looks 
                                      consistent across all viewport widths although some of the methods used were different, the 
                                      outcome was the same. I used mainly flex-box to attain a responsive layout, and SaaS to help 
                                      speed the website up.<br><br>
                                      I used a mixture of code I had written, and plug-ins to implement the JS used in the NetMatters 
                                      home page. I found that writing the code was good to help understand fundamental basics of JS and 
                                      using the plug-ins allowed me to learn when it is more efficient and effective to use a plug-in.<br><br>
                                      I used PHP/MySQL to create two databases, a contact form, and a blog. The contact form uses it’s on 
                                      table in the database to store any contact forms that are sent, and the blog uses it’s on table to 
                                      generate the latest blog posts.<br><br>

                                      I really really liked this task, having a design to work of and using Peeper tool made this 
                                      fun and enjoyable.

                                     for SEO purposes. <br>
                                     The reflection tasks were as follows:<br>
                                      <br>
                                    - Build a 5 page WordPress website, with SEO in-mind<br>
                                    - Your reflection should include, but is not limited to:<br>
                                    - Homepage<br>
                                    - Contact Page<br>
                                    - News<br>
                                    - Gallery images that open within a lightbox<br>
                                    <br>
                                     I really enjoyed this reflection, I had some previous WordPress experience and doing the course and reflection 
                                     helped grow my knowledge and experience with it. I chose to do the reflection based on my side project 
                                     as I had a lot of the media already and it was something close to me.
