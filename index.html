                                    I started my work career at 15 and my first job was in removals, it was a good way to earn some money over the summer holidays,
                                    but it did not last long as the company went under.<br><br>
                                    I then went through several jobs, from office clerk to warehouse operative to air conditioning installer apprentice.
                                    It was when I started carpentry, I found something I really enjoyed and stuck with for 6 years.<br><br>
                                    After that I went in to accounting, I was holding down two jobs, one was an apprenticeship as an Income assistant at Hanover housing
                                    and the other was a market operator at Betfair and was also studying accountancy two nights a week. 
                                    I was then lucky enough to get a job at the Follett Office where I would have my accounting qualifications paid for by the company. 
                                    Halfway through I was earning good money, but the job was not fulfilling a missing part of me.<br><br>
                                    I started a side project called The Human Codex which is a side project of mine. It ended up taking me to Croatia traveling for 6 months, 
                                    and back to the UK again. The whole process made me realise I really wanted to be a web developer, after seeing what others were able to do
                                    I wanted to have the skills and knowledge to finish making the platform myself.<br><br>
                                    I ended up finding out about the Netmatters Scion scheme, ever since I have been working hard daily to achieve my dream of becoming
                                    a web developer.

                              </div>
                                <div class="text work-text hide"> 
                                  <span>                          
                                    <p>
                                      I always find these types of things hard to write but I will give it a go. I am a trainee web developer
                                      who has a passion for life. I love all things tech, fantasy, sci-fi and life really. I work hard, 
                                      try my best at what I do and always try to do the right thing, which sometimes ends up to my detriment.<br><br>

                                      I have had a number of different jobs, a wide range of life experiences and many stories to share. I do 
                                      enjoy the company of other people; I just find it hard sometimes. I was diagnosed as High Functioning 
                                      Autistic and ADHD when I was 30, which really hit me for six but as time has gone on, I have learned 
                                      how to handle the diagnosis and try to use it to my advantage. I believe I wasn’t really self-aware of 
                                      my self until this point, literally livig in my own fantasy world not really knowing what or how I may 
                                      of affected other people and in turn what they thought of/about me.<br><br>

                                      With a strong sense of justice, I always try to do the right thing, and not to let anyone done, although this
                                      tends to get me in trouble sometimes. I am not a gameplayer when it comes to people and am a straight shooter
                                        some have said. This doesn’t mean I try to be awkward I just try my best at making sure the right thing is 
                                        done for everyone.<br><br>

                                      I hope to get to live to see the day that humanity has a colony on another celestial body and or we are visited
                                      from another species not from this world. I have faith that one day humanity will become the species it has the
                                        potential to be and things like war, poverty, greed and corruption will no longer play a role in humanities future.<br><br>
                                        
                                      My family are the most important thing to me, I love my son more than words could ever descirbe, I will do anything for him 
                                      and hope when he grows up he is proud of the man I have become. I couldn't ask for a better partner and will love her until 
                                      my heart stops beating.<br><br>

                                      The main thing I wish for in life is that they both get to live long and happy lives, I will do whatever I can to make that
                                      the reality.

                                            - The ability to add a new customer.<br>
                                            -         The ability to control how many items can be ordered.<br>

                                            This took me a little bit of time to get my head round but once I did I enjoyed the task

                                          The mark-up for the site is written and is styled to match the site, ensuring the site looks 
                                          consistent across all viewport widths although some of the methods used were different, the 
                                          outcome was the same. I used mainly flex-box to attain a responsive layout, and SaaS to help 
                                          speed the website up.<br><br>
                                          I used a mixture of code I had written, and plug-ins to implement the JS used in the NetMatters 
                                          home page. I found that writing the code was good to help understand fundamental basics of JS and 
                                          using the plug-ins allowed me to learn when it is more efficient and effective to use a plug-in.<br><br>
                                          I used PHP/MySQL to create two databases, a contact form, and a blog. The contact form used is on a 
                                          table in the database to store any contact forms that are sent, and the blog uses it’s own table to 
                                          generate the latest blog posts.<br><br>

                                          I really, really, liked this task, having a design to work of and using Peeper tool made this 
                                          fun and enjoyable.

                                          The reflection tasks were as follows:<br>

                                        - Build a 5-page WordPress website, with SEO in-mind<br>
                                        - Your reflection should include, but is not limited to:<br>
                                        - Homepage<br>

                                          I really enjoyed this reflection, I had some previous WordPress experience and doing the course and reflection 
                                          helped grow my knowledge and experience with it. I chose to do the reflection based on my side project 
                                          as I had a lot of the media already and it was something close to me.

                                        </div> 
                                        <div class="textBox2">  
                                          <span>                          
                                            <p>
                                              I started my work career at 15 and my first job was in removals, it was a good way to earn some money over the summer holidays,
                                              but it did not last long as the company went under.<br><br>
                                              I then went through several jobs, from office clerk to warehouse operative to air conditioning installer apprentice.
                                              It was when I started carpentry, I found something I really enjoyed and stuck with for 6 years.<br><br>
                                              After that I went in to accounting, I was holding down two jobs, one was an apprenticeship as an Income assistant at Hanover housing
                                              and the other was a market operator at Betfair and was also studying accountancy two nights a week. 
                                              I was then lucky enough to get a job at the Follett Office where I would have my accounting qualifications paid for by the company. 
                                              Halfway through I was earning good money, but the job was not fulfilling a missing part of me.<br><br>
                                              I started a side project called The Human Codex which is a side project of mine. It ended up taking me to Croatia traveling for 6 months, 
                                              and back to the UK again. The whole process made me realise I really wanted to be a web developer, after seeing what others were able to do
                                              I wanted to have the skills and knowledge to finish making the platform myself.<br><br>
                                              I ended up finding out about the Netmatters Scion scheme, ever since I have been working hard daily to achieve my dream of becoming
                                              a web developer.

                                            <p>
                                              I always find these types of things hard to write but I will give it a go. I am a trainee web developer
                                              who has a passion for life. I love all things tech, fantasy, sci-fi and life really. I work hard, 
                                              try my best at what I do and always try to do the right thing, which sometimes ends up to my detriment.<br><br>

                                              I have had a number of different jobs, a wide range of life experiences and many stories to share. I do 
                                              enjoy the company of other people; I just find it hard sometimes. I was diagnosed as High Functioning 
                                              Autistic and ADHD when I was 30, which really hit me for six but as time has gone on, I have learned 
                                              how to handle the diagnosis and try to use it to my advantage. I believe I wasn’t really self-aware of 
                                              my self until this point, literally livig in my own fantasy world not really knowing what or how I may 
                                              of affected other people and in turn what they thought of/about me.<br><br>

                                              With a strong sense of justice, I always try to do the right thing, and not to let anyone done, although this
                                              tends to get me in trouble sometimes. I am not a gameplayer when it comes to people and am a straight shooter
                                                some have said. This doesn’t mean I try to be awkward I just try my best at making sure the right thing is 
                                                done for everyone.<br><br>

                                              I hope to get to live to see the day that humanity has a colony on another celestial body and or we are visited
                                              from another species not from this world. I have faith that one day humanity will become the species it has the
                                                potential to be and things like war, poverty, greed and corruption will no longer play a role in humanities future.<br><br>
                                                
                                              My family are the most important thing to me, I love my son more than words could ever descirbe, I will do anything for him 
                                              and hope when he grows up he is proud of the man I have become. I couldn't ask for a better partner and will love her until 
                                              my heart stops beating.<br><br>

                                              The main thing I wish for in life is that they both get to live long and happy lives, I will do whatever I can to make that
                                              the reality.

                                                      - The ability to add a new customer.<br>

                                                    The mark-up for the site is written and is styled to match the site, ensuring the site looks 
                                                    consistent across all viewport widths although some of the methods used were different, the 
                                                    outcome was the same. I used mainly flex-box to attain a responsive layout, and SaaS to help 
                                                    speed the website up.<br><br>
                                                    I used a mixture of code I had written, and plug-ins to implement the JS used in the NetMatters 
                                                    home page. I found that writing the code was good to help understand fundamental basics of JS and 
                                                    using the plug-ins allowed me to learn when it is more efficient and effective to use a plug-in.<br><br>
                                                    I used PHP/MySQL to create two databases, a contact form, and a blog. The contact form used is on a 
                                                    table in the database to store any contact forms that are sent, and the blog uses it’s own table to 
                                                    generate the latest blog posts.<br><br>

                                                    -         If the email address has multiple linked images - please display this.<br><br>

                                                  sure each car was charged enough for the following day's journeys. The criteria were:<br><br>

                                                  -         Each car needed to have the full charge needed for the following day<br>
                                                  -         There needed to be a 10% buffer for each car.<br>
                                                  -         The user must be able to input the Registration, Input Miles, Output miles and leave time.<br>
                                                  -         The schedule needed to be on a calendar from 07:00 am – 16:00 with the charging times blocked
                                                    out.<br>
                                                  -         The schedule needed to calculate the number of miles needed and hours in order for it to work.<br><br> 
                                                    
                                                  This took me a lot of time and I used Stack Overflow for reference and help to complete the project.
                                                    It gave my practice in not only searching for the answers but asking for help if I could not find 
                                                    the answer I was looking for.<br><br>
